# Welcome to the AYON Cpp Api Project

The AYON Cpp Api allows communication with the Ayon server.\n The Cpp api is
mainly focused on communication with the server Resolve endpoint.

If you want easy full access to all the server functions the
[Ayon Python Api](https://github.com/ynput/ayon-python-api) might be a better
choice.
